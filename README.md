## Intro

Before you begin make sure your composer is updated and if you don't have one please download and install

This source code can be run on php version 7 and 8 but i highly recommend run on php version 8 as it is more stable and updated.

## Requirements
1. Composer (Installed on local machine)
2. Php version 7 or 8
3. xamp or lamp or remote database (as long as you have credentials for that database)

# Installation

I've created bash script so you will have easy installation on this so to begin make sure you already have all the requirements given above.

Run this script

Just follow the instruction and everything will be alright.
